\title{Get sample-level clonotype counts}
\usage{
summarizeClonotypes(x, by, ...)

\S4method{summarizeClonotypes}{Matrix}(x, by, mode = c("sum", "tab"), lang = c("r", "python"))

\S4method{summarizeClonotypes}{SingleCellExperiment}(x, by = "sample", clonoStats = "clonoStats", ...)

\S4method{summarizeClonotypes}{matrix}(x, by, ...)

\S4method{summarizeClonotypes}{clonoStats}(x, by, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A (usually sparse) matrix of cell-level clonotype counts (cells are
rows and clonotypes are columns). Alternatively, a
\code{\link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}} with such a matrix
stored in the \code{colData}.}

\item{by}{A character vector or factor by which to summarize the clonotype
counts. If \code{x} is a \code{SingleCellExperiment} object, this can also
be a character, giving the name of the column from the \code{colData} to
use as this variable.}

\item{...}{additional arguments.}

\item{mode}{Type of summarization to perform. Default is \code{'sum'}, which
sums clonotype abundances within each sample (or level of \code{'by'}).
Alternative is \code{'tab'}, which constructs a table of clonotype
frequencies (ie. singletons, doubletons, etc.) by sample.}

\item{lang}{Indicates which implementation of the \code{"tab"} summarization
to use. Options are \code{'r'} (default) or \code{'python'}. Only used if
non-integer clonotype abundances are present and \code{mode = "tab"}.}

\item{clonoStats}{character. If \code{x} is a \code{SingleCellExperiment},
the name of the element in the \code{metadata} of \code{x} that contains
the output of \code{clonoStats}. Must include cell-level clonotype
assignments (ie. \code{assignment = TRUE}).}
}
\value{
A matrix clonotype counts where each row corresponds to a unique
value of \code{by} (if \code{by} denotes sample labels, this is a matrix of
sample-level clonotype counts).
}
\description{
Takes a matrix of cell-level clonotype counts and sums them
within groups (typically samples).
}
\examples{
example(addVDJtoSCE)
x <- clonoStats(contigs, assignment = TRUE)
summarizeClonotypes(x, by = sce$sample)
